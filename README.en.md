## Repository Overview

This repository is dedicated to housing documentation for various frameworks within the GEEK-XD ecosystem, such as RuoYi-Geek-SpringBoot3, RuoYi-Geek-Vue3, RuoYi-Geek-App, and RuoYi-Geek-Electron.

## Introduction to the GEEK-XD Ecosystem

The original versions of RuoYi-Vue and RuoYi-App were built on SpringBoot2 + Vue2 as enterprise-level development frameworks, receiving widespread love and positive feedback from developers. However, with the advancement of technology, SpringBoot3 and Vue3 have gradually caught the attention of developers. To meet the demand for new technologies, the official RuoYi documentation provides an upgrade path from SpringBoot2 to SpringBoot3. At the same time, community-driven versions like RuoYi-Vue3 and RuoYi-App-Vue3 have emerged, showcasing the community's enthusiasm and effort towards technological upgrades.

However, during the upgrade process, the official methods retained some old features for compatibility with Java 1.8, not fully embracing all the characteristics of SpringBoot3 and Java 17. Meanwhile, the community's RuoYi-Vue3 and RuoYi-App-Vue3 versions, developed by different teams, exhibited some shortcomings in terms of compatibility and integration. More critically, although these versions support TypeScript, they lack a suitable tsconfig.json configuration file, resulting in suboptimal TypeScript syntax hinting environments in mainstream editors like VSCode.

In response to these issues, the RuoYi-Geek ecosystem was born. It aims to provide developers with a comprehensive solution that retains the core features of the original version while integrating the advantages of community editions. In RuoYi-Geek, we have extensively researched commonly used RuoYi extensions in enterprise development and integrated them directly into the framework to ensure developers can get started quickly and develop efficiently. We have adopted the latest SpringBoot3 + Vue3 tech stack, completely removing old methods retained for Java 1.8 compatibility. Importantly, we have added common tsconfig.json configurations for the TypeScript development environment, ensuring developers receive a more comfortable and convenient syntax hinting experience in editors like VSCode.

Furthermore, we plan to inject even more super-practical tools into this framework and its companions, making daily development or enterprise projects easier to handle! Imagine having a moment where one of our small tools boosts your efficiency so much it feels like you've got a power-up! We sincerely hope this framework becomes an indispensable assistant to you, making your work less "grueling" and more enjoyable, efficient, and comfortable. XDðŸ˜„ \\(@^0^@)/

RuoYi-Geek is not just a simple upgrade; it's a comprehensive optimization and integration of the RuoYi ecosystem. We believe that through RuoYi-Geek, developers will be able to develop excellent enterprise applications more efficiently and joyfully.

## Framework Introduction

### RuoYi-Geek-SpringBoot3

This framework is a Java rapid development framework based on SpringBoot3 + Vue3 with front-end and back-end separation.

This framework represents the Springboot 3 backend version of our ecosystem. Paired with the Vue3 version of the RuoYi Geek ecosystem, this version has carried out foundational design work on payment modules and third-party login modules, and significantly enhanced the code generator, now supporting field-level associated table operations. Additionally, an online API development module has been added, allowing users to modify interfaces using MyBatis online. Other functional modules are continuously being updated and perfected.

### RuoYi-Geek-Vue3

This framework is a Java rapid development framework based on SpringBoot3 + Vue3 with front-end and back-end separation.

This framework represents the Vue3 frontend version of our ecosystem. Currently, it has added support for three.js, and works alongside the Springboot 3 backend version of the RuoYi Geek ecosystem. This version has also carried out foundational design work on payment modules and third-party login modules, and significantly enhanced the code generator, now supporting field-level associated table operations. Additionally, an online API development module has been added, allowing users to modify interfaces using MyBatis online. Other functional modules are continuously being updated and perfected.

### RuoYi-Geek-App

The RuoYi Geek ecosystem App version is a secondary development based on the RuoYi-App framework, adopting the Uniapp combined with Vue3 tech stack. It supports both JavaScript and TypeScript development and is compatible with CSS, SCSS, and Less style languages. For performance optimization, we have implemented initial code segmentation. Moreover, we have integrated uview-plus, uchart, and related templates for reference and use.

### RuoYi-Geek-Electron

RuoYi-Geek-Electron aims to build a comfortable desktop application environment for RuoYi-Geek-SpringBoot3 and RuoYi-Geek-Vue3, simplifying development with decorators. It is currently under development.
